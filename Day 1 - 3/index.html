            <p>
                 Well I have not figured it out yet but i do know it has been my passion and feel little butterflies in my stomach just writing this basic boilerplate already...lol. </br> </br>Well I think I figured I first left it to chase money to buy a system since the ones borrowed kept spoiling but i think I'm realizing that i am getting lost in it. </br></br>Might pause for a while since I am using my phone and it is stressful plus i am on a pause from my grind so idk but I will put in work everyday and try to keep a streak at least 30 mins everyday... wish me good luck.
