**Project:** Part of [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/Jhx3y/100-Days-of-Code)  
**Author:** [@Jhx3y](https://github.com/Jhx3y)

## 🧠 Overview
This project features a **responsive landing page hero section** built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.  
It demonstrates **modular CSS architecture** — splitting style logic into multiple files for **scalability** and **maintainability**:

- `variables.css` – defines global colors, fonts, and animations  
- `style.css` – handles base styles, utilities, and layout  
- `queries.css` – manages responsive breakpoints and adjustments  
- `script.js` – adds interactivity for the mobile navbar toggle

## ✨ Features
- Responsive **Flexbox-based layout**
- Animated **fade-in hero text**
- **Navbar toggle** on mobile using JS  
- CSS **variables** for reusable styling
- Clean **form section** with input and button
- Subtle hover and focus effects
- Modular structure for better code reusability

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- CSS **Flexbox & Media Queries**
- **Pseudo-classes** like `:hover` and `:focus`
- CSS **Variables (`--custom-properties`)**
- **DOM Manipulation** and event handling in JS
- Component scalability & responsive design thinking
