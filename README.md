# 🧠 100 Days of Code — Frontend Journey by Jhey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code Challenge**!  
This repo documents my daily progress as I learn, build, and grow as a **frontend developer** — coding every single day for 100 days.

---

## 📅 About the Challenge
The goal is simple:  
> Code something meaningful every day for 100 consecutive days — learning, improving, and documenting along the way.

I’ll be focusing mainly on:
- HTML, CSS & Responsive Design  
- JavaScript (as I progress)  
- UI/UX fundamentals  
- Frontend Mentor projects  
- Experimenting with creative web ideas

## 🗂 Project Structure

Each day’s challenge lives in its own folder:
📦 100-Days-of-Code ┣ 📁 Day-01 ┣ 📁 Day-02 ┣ 📁 Day-03 ┣ ... ┣ 📁Day-100┗ 📜 README.md

Each folder includes:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- (sometimes) `script.js`
- a `README.md` for that day’s explanation and reflection
